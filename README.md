These slides are to present the three different Contextual Bandits based on the paper authored by Ambuj Tewari and Susan A. Murphy. Contextual Bandits are bandits that having covariate effects. The most interesting part of this paper is identifying the different assumptions behind the three different Contextual Bandits, as well as the limitations and advantages of them. The algorithms to estimate the parameters of the bandits models are also introduced. 

The original paper is also attached, in case someone may want to read more about it.

These slides are to present the three different Contextual Bandits based on the paper authored by Ambuj Tewari and Susan A. Murphy. The most interesting part of this paper is the assumptions behind the three different Contextual Bandits, the limitations and advantages of them. The algorithms to estimate the parameters of the bandits models are also introduced.
